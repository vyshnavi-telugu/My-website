      <p style="color:violet">Ayodhya, town in northern India that is known as a sacred city and the birthplace of Rama in Hinduism and as a historical center of Buddhism. On a site significant to both Hindus and Muslims was a Mughal-era mosque, the Babri Masjid, which was destroyed in 1992 amid interreligious tensions. After a 2019 Supreme Court verdict granting the site to Hindus, a new Ram temple was built, opening on January 22, 2024. Ayodhya lies on the Ghaghara River, locally known as Sarayu or Sarju, just east of Faizabad in south-central Uttar Pradesh state.</p>
